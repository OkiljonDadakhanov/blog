    "content": "# On Attention\n\nWhat we choose to notice shapes who we become.\n\nIn an age of infinite scroll, the most radical act might be to stop and look closely at one thing. Not with the hurried glance of someone checking items off a list, but with the sustained focus of someone genuinely curious.\n\nI've been thinking about attention as a form of prayer—not in a religious sense, but as Mary Oliver meant it: \"Attention is the beginning of devotion.\" When we give our full attention to something, we are saying, in effect, that it matters. That it deserves our limited time and mental energy.\n\nThe opposite of attention isn't distraction, exactly. It's a kind of glazed-over semi-presence where we are nowhere in particular, not really here, not really anywhere.\n\nThis essay is an attempt to think through what it means to attend to the world carefully, deliberately, without the expectation of productivity or outcome. Just noticing. Just being present to what is. helllllllaaaaaaaaaaaa yeah"

    "content": "# The Case for Slow Reading\n\nIn defense of rereading and lingering over difficult texts.\n\nThere's a certain kind of reading that has fallen out of favor: the slow, repetitive, puzzling-over-a-single-sentence kind. The kind where you read a paragraph, pause, stare out the window, then read it again.\n\nWe live in an era of speed reading techniques, book summary apps, and the pressure to \"consume\" as much content as possible. But some books aren't meant to be consumed—they're meant to be inhabited.\n\nI'm thinking of books like Annie Dillard's *Pilgrim at Tinker Creek* or Marilynne Robinson's *Gilead*. Books where the pleasure isn't in racing to find out what happens, but in savoring the texture of each sentence.\n\nSlow reading is counterproductive by design. It takes time you could spend on other books. It requires patience in a world that rewards efficiency. But it offers something rare: depth, nuance, the feeling of thought unfolding at a human pace.\n\nThis isn't about reading fewer books—it's about reading some books differently. Some books deserve to be read the way you'd walk through an old forest: slowly, with all your senses engaged, willing to get lost."
