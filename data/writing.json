    "content": "# On Attention\n\nWhat we choose to notice shapes who we become.\n\nIn an age of infinite scroll, the most radical act might be to stop and look closely at one thing. Not with the hurried glance of someone checking items off a list, but with the sustained focus of someone genuinely curious.\n\nI've been thinking about attention as a form of prayer—not in a religious sense, but as Mary Oliver meant it: \"Attention is the beginning of devotion.\" When we give our full attention to something, we are saying, in effect, that it matters. That it deserves our limited time and mental energy.\n\nThe opposite of attention isn't distraction, exactly. It's a kind of glazed-over semi-presence where we are nowhere in particular, not really here, not really anywhere.\n\nThis essay is an attempt to think through what it means to attend to the world carefully, deliberately, without the expectation of productivity or outcome. Just noticing. Just being present to what is. helllllllaaaaaaaaaaaa yeah"
